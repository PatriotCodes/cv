#### Hello!
My name is Alexander Triukhan. I am a frontend developer from Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine.
I first met programming when I was 12 and had an opportunity to attend Pascal courses at school.
That was the time when I became interested in coding and decided to tie my life with it!
Today I am passioned with developing frontend applications with JS language using modern frontend frameworks
and technologies.
In fact, I am so passioned and busy I haven't got time to write a proper cv yet. So I left you
my computer. I am pretty sure you will find all you are interested in there.

P.S. If it's still not enough information for you or you have a medical condition against vintage interfaces Clippy is there to help you ;-)
